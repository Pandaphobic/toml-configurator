## TOML Configurator - Proof of Concept

This is a super simple test run for a configurator that reads and outputs to config.toml

I expect to use something very similar for [`Node Crypto Tracker`](https://github.com/Pandaphobic/node-crypto-tracker)

#### Output Example

```
[ticker]
  coins = ["ethereum","litecoin","bitcoin","weth","usd-coin"]
  vsCurrency = "usd"
  refreshRate = 500
```
